Welcome to the documentation of BMAPI (Busmust Device Communication Application Programming Interface).

The BMAPI SDK provided by Busmust Co.,Ltd. consists of a collection of runtime libraries and examples which allow the real-time connection of applications to all CAN buses physically connected to a PC using Busmust devices. 
SDK is available on the platforms below:
1. WindowsXP/Windows7/Windows8/Windows10/Windows11 X86 (32-bit/64-bit)
2. Linux32 X86 (e.g. Ubuntu 32-bit)
3. Linux64 X86 (e.g. Ubuntu 64-bit)
4. ARM32 (e.g. Raspbian 32-bit)
5. ARM64 (e.g. Raspbian 64-bit)

For support on other platform/OS, please contact Busmust support. 

Please connect your Busmust USB devices to your host PC before using the SDK.
Devices supported by the SDK include:
1. BM-USB-CANFD-X1PRO
2. BM-USB-CANFD-X1
3. BM-USB-CAN-C1PRO
4. BM-USB-CAN-C1
5. BM-USB-CAN-X2
6. BM-USB-CAN-X4

Other devices might also be supported as well, see our website for details.

The generic programming sequence of an application that calls BMAPI is as follows:

Please take a glance at the documentation of API and Data Types before getting started, so that you know what our SDK could do for you.
And then start by reading the examples written in your favourite language/framework (VC++/C#/Qt/Python).
Then you would find it very easy to start your own work based on the examples.
Contact Busmust support in case of any problems.

Now let's go!
